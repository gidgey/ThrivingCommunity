# ThrivingCommunity
You can't have a thriving codebase without a thriving community.

# What does code have to do with community?

Free and Open Source Software depends upon the community who builds, creates, maintains, supports, translates, and markets it. That means any Open Source project depends upon a volunteer-based workforce.

We all recognize that our livlihoods are somewhat attributed to the ability to use Free and Open Source Software -- like WordPress -- so we volunteer, contribute, to give back.

What about burnout?

It's real. 

We've addressed it before in many ways. So let's talk about how what a thriving community looks like.

# What is a thriving community?

A thriving community realizes they can ebb and flow in and out of a project. They can contribute for months or years, take a break, maybe even mentor others, and come back -- or not.

A thriving community recruits volunteers based upon inclusion, not guilt.

A thriving community isn't burnt out or bitter.

A thriving community is healthy -- physically, emotionally, and financially.
